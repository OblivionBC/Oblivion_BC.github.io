					<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
					<p>Why thank you for asking! I am a passionate Computer Science student born in 2005. I am currently
						attending
						<a href="https://www.viu.ca/">Vancouver Island University</a> and living on Vancouver Island. I
						touched my first computer
						age of 11 and fell in love with the creativity and customizability of it. I have unfortunately
						been chronically online
						ever since, but it has created a passion to become a computer science student and create things
						that will inspire an 11 year old
						somewhere around the world (hopefully not inspiring them to build a pillow fort around the
						computer to hide it from their parents).
						I love to learn about everything computer science related, and give my all into doing whatever I
						am learning currently.

					<p>This multi script data structure was created in C++ for a school assignment. I implemeneted error
						handling
						and dynamic memory allocation, as well as various standard functions including multiple insert
						and remove functions.

					<p>This solo school assignment was my first project writing in CSS 3 and HTML 5.
						In this
						project I learned how to use HTML 5 to create a multi-page website and CSS 3 to style it.
						Even though I handed this assignment in, I am still tinkering with it to apply
						new concepts I learn outside of class.

						<h2><a href="#">Throwing Database<br />
								WIP</a></h2>
					</header>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/ThrowProj.png" alt="" /></a>
					<p>This is my passion project. If you read my about me page you know I am a competitive track and
						field athlete.
						My goal for this is to create a cross-platform database application to assist in stat-tracking
						and training
						for track and field athletes of all levels. I have guaged interests from Olympic level athletes
						and coaches
						and am excited to progress this further.

						<h2><a href="#">2D Platformer<br />
								Unreal Engine 5 WIP</a></h2>
					</header>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/2D.png" alt="" /></a>
					<p>This is in it's very early stages as a personal project. I am experimenting with Unreal Engine 5,
						and game development.
						I have made a 2D platformer using the Unity Engine which was unfortunately lost when I deleted
						my Unity hub, but am attempting
						to swap to Unreal Engine. I am doing all of the coding and rigging on my own but using free
						assets
						since my artistic abilities are quite lacking.
