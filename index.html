					<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
					<p>Why thank you for asking! I am a passionate Computer Science student from Vancouver Island. I am
						currently
						attending
						<a href="https://www.viu.ca/">Vancouver Island University</a> and am planning to transfer to UBC
						next year
						after signing with their Track and Field team.
						I touched my first computer
						age of 11 and fell in love with the creativity and customizability of it (and Overwatch). I have
						unfortunately
						been chronically online
						ever since, but it has created a passion to become a computer science student and create games
						and software
						that will inspire an 11 year old
						somewhere around the world (hopefully not inspiring them to build a pillow fort around the
						computer to hide it from their parents).
						I love to learn about everything computer science related, and give my all into doing whatever I
						am learning currently.

						<h2><a href="#">Project Jump<br />
								Unreal Engine 5 WIP</a></h2>
					</header>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/2D.png" alt="" /></a>
					<p>
						This is a school project for my software engineering class. We have a team of game
						developers working
						on it currently. It is a procedurally generated 2D platformer with 3D graphics inspired by a
						mix of Jetpack
						Joyride and
						Jump King. So far I have designed our SDLC, our git workflow, documentations for standards and
						the game,
						as well as implemented the first version of our player and interaction system. I am very excited
						for this project and
						what is to
						come of it!

						<h2><a href="#">Database App<br /> C++, SQL, Interbase
							</a></h2>
					</header>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/DBApp.png" alt="" /></a>
					<p>This was a scaled down proof of concept version of my app that I am designing as a database with
						a GUI. This
						app I made runs off
						of interbase and uses SQL queries to input data from my Track and Field meets. You first input
						the meet name, date, and
						ID, it then creates a corrosponding row in bot the Shotput and Discus data graphs where I input
						my distances, in this picture Shotput
						only has 1 column since I injured myself and could not throw Shotput at that meet. It then
						calculates the averages of each meet, and the best throw. Now, it is no Google Sheets or
						Microsoft Excel (yet) but it
						was very valuable in helping me envision what I will need for the final version of my app (which
						you can read about lower on this page).

						<h2><a href="#">Throwing Database<br />
								MERN STACK DATABASE WIP</a></h2>
					</header>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/ThrowProj.png" alt="" /></a>
					<p>This is my passion project. If you read my about my page you know I am a competitive track and
						field athlete.
						My goal for this is to create a cross-platform database application to assist in stat-tracking
						and training
						for track and field athletes of all levels. I have guaged interests from Olympic level athletes
						and coaches
						and am SUPER excited to progress this further.

						<h2><a href="#">StackyCapy </br> C++, Unreal Engine
							</a></h2>
					</header>
					<video class="image fit" controls>
						<source src="images/CapyGameDemo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
						The video does nmot work in this format
					</video>
					<p>This is a game I imagined after my social media was filled with capybaras for a whole month. I
						thought stacking them would be super cute and fun,
						so that is what I made! So far I have finalized the character which serves as the core gameplay
						mechanics for the game. You can stack capybaras that
						you find on top of you, as well as swap to the highest stacked one. The capybaras get smaller
						the more you have stacked. I did this by creating a
						customized character class for my capybaras with all of the functionalities it needs, as well as
						attatchable actor objects, and a game mode. This is
						still a work in progress but I have had so much fun making it!
