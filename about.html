					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p>Here you will learn about my athletics, hobbies, and background.</p>
				</header>


				<h2 style="text-align: center;">Athletics</h2>
				<div class="image main"><img src="images/action.png" alt="" /></div>
				<p>I am currently a <a href="https://athletics.ca/athlete/connor-hengstler/">Nationally ranked track and
						field athlete</a>, with my main events being discus and
					shotput and dabbling in a bit of hammer.
					I compete with the Nanaimo Track and Field Club which is very handy since it is directly below VIU
					residences where I live.
					When I enjoy something, I find even more joy in mastering it as I do with programming, track is no
					exception.
					I powerlift 2-5 days a week and practice 2-3 days a week to improve myself. I also feel that all
					programmers should
					find some sport that they like, or physical activity. It is a good way to blow off steam, and keep
					your body active after
					sitting at a chair
					most of the day looking for a data leak!
				</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: center;">Hobbies</h2>
				<div class="image main"><img src="images/qigbmfa8hmb51.webp" alt="" /></div>
				<p>To wind down after a long day of learning and going up an absurd amount of stairs to get to class,
					I have a couple things that I like to do.
					I play video-games. Like I play them a lot. I mentioned earlier that I touched a computer when I was
					11,
					that was to play Minecraft and Overwatch, and I still play both of those games. I love games not
					only because of the communities,
					but also because
					I can
					get exactly what experience I want out of them. Long day? I can play minecraft and make and feed my
					axolotls that look like
					ponyo from the texture I downloaded. Need some adrenaline?
					Play Dota 2 and scream at my monitor when I die after teleporting into 5 people in a ranked game.
					On top of gaming, I also like to cook a lot. My favourite thing to make
					currently is bulgogi beef rice bowls with japanese barbecue mayo, so yummy!
				</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: center;">Background</h2>
				<div class="image main"><img src="images/saltspring.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
				<p>
					I was born on Saltspring Island which is pretty cool, if you like nature and are not afraid of grass
					(I am sometimes).
					Although it has its charm, there is not a whole lot to do
					other
					than exploring the wilderness; and I was not much of a wilderness explorer like Russel. I lived
					there and
					commuted
					over a ferry to school until 2016 where my family moved to Duncan where we had been commuting for
					school. I graduated
					in 2022 at 17 years old with Honours, and Student of Distinction awards. I was then accepted
					into
					VIU's Computer Science program and moved onto the Student Residences to start my first year of
					university. After the first year I was accepted to become a Community Leader on residences, which is
					my
					current occupation.
