					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p>Here you will learn about my athletics, hobbies, and background.</p>
				</header>


				<h2 style="text-align: center;">Athletics</h2>
				<div class="image main"><img src="images/action.png" alt="" /></div>
				<p>I am currently a <a href="https://athletics.ca/athlete/connor-hengstler/">Nationally ranked track and
						field athlete</a>, with my main events being shotput and
					discus.
					I compete with the Nanaimo Track and Field Club which is very handy since it is directly below VIU
					residences where I live.
					When I enjoy something, I find even more joy in mastering it as I do with programming, track is no
					exception.
					I powerlift 2-5 days a week and practice 2-3 days a week to improve myself. I also feel that all
					programmers should
					find some sport that they like. It is a good way to blow off steam, and keep your body active after
					sitting at a chair
					most of the day!
				</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: center;">Hobbies</h2>
				<div class="image main"><img src="images/qigbmfa8hmb51.webp" alt="" /></div>
				<p>To wind down after a long day of writing proofs and learning, I have a couple things that I like to
					do.
					I play video-games. Like I play them a lot. I mentioned earlier that I touched a computer when I was
					11,
					that was to play Minecraft and Overwatch, and I still play both of those games. I love games because
					I can
					get exactly what I want out of them. Long day? I can play a relaxing game. Need some adrenaline?
					Competition or horror game. On top of gaming, I also like to cook a lot. My favourite thing to make
					currently is any type of sushi with spicy kewpie mayo, so yummy!
				</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: center;">Background</h2>
				<div class="image main"><img src="images/saltspring.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
				<p>
					I was born on Saltspring Island in 2005. Although it has its charm, there is not a whole lot to do
					other
					than exploring the wilderness; and I was not much of a wilderness explorer. I lived there and
					commuted
					over a ferry to school until 2016 where my family moved to Duncan where we went to school. I
					attended Duncan
					Christian School from grade 7 to grade 12 and graduated in 2022 at 17 years old. I then was accepted
					into
					VIU's Computer Science program and moved onto the Student Residences to start my first year of
					university. Going forward I have been hired as a
					Community Leader on Student Residence for next year and am hoping to enjoy University as much as I
					did this year!
